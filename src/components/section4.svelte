		My Portfolio Website was a project that I aimed to be a visual representation of me as a
		Developer and Designer. My main goal for the current iteration of the project was expanding my
		JS and CSS toolkit, putting an emphasis on animations and smooth experience as well as creating
		a simple but immersive design. The website makes use of multiple third party libraries such as
		AOS and Animate.css, however, a significant part of the animations was done from scratch by
		myself.
